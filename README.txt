EduDigital â€” demo static site
----------------------------

Files in this zip:
- index.html           (landing page)
- styles.css           (local styles + simple animations)
- script.js            (product rendering, cart, checkout demo)
- assets/              (three SVG placeholders)

How to run:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. The Checkout action simulates downloads by creating small demo files in-browser.

Notes:
- This is a static demo meant as a starter template. For production you'll want to:
  * Replace placeholder assets with real thumbnails.
  * Integrate a real payment gateway (Midtrans, Stripe, etc.).
  * Serve files from secure storage and protect downloads behind purchase verification.
  * Add server/backend for subscriptions, user accounts, and order records.
